## Tenets

1. **Have fun**. This is a hobby project not constrained by monetary returns or timelines.
2. **Prioritize your use-case**. There is a lot of variation in hardware and OS versions. Make sure the software works for _you_ and provide a reasonable fallback for the others instead of getting stuck on 100% implementation.
